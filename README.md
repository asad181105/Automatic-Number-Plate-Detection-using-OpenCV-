# Automatic-Number-Plate-Detection-using-OpenCV

A computer vision project that detects and extracts vehicle number plates from images or video streams using OpenCV and Python. The system applies image preprocessing, contour detection, and OCR to accurately identify license plate text, with applications in traffic monitoring and automated security systems.

Key Features:

Real-time number plate detection from video or image input

Image preprocessing using grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contour filtering

OCR integration for extracting alphanumeric text from number plates

Built using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR
